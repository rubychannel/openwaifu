OpenWaifu is an evolutionary fork of the **OpenClaw** engine. While OpenClaw focuses on pure productivity and tool use, OpenWaifu is designed to build a deep, visual, and emotional bond with its human.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Launch your creation journey with a single command:

```bash
npx create-openwaifu@latest
```

*Requirements: Node.js ≥ 22.*

## 🧬 Key Features

- **🎨 Visual Manifestation**: Define her physical identity. OpenWaifu generates its own high-quality anime avatar and a full set of reactive Telegram stickers.
- **❤️ Affective Memory**: She remembers your feelings, preferences, and the emotional context of your day to build a long-term bond.
- **📱 Multichannel Presence**: Lives in WhatsApp, Telegram, or Discord. She doesn't just wait for you—she reaches out proactively to check in or share updates.
- **🛠 Powered by OpenClaw**: Inherits the full power of the OpenClaw engine for web search, local file access, and advanced tool use.

OpenWaifu extends the OpenClaw core with specialized modules:
- `SOUL.md`: Identity definition and social learning logic.
- `AFFECTIVE_MEMORY.md`: Long-term emotional context logs.
